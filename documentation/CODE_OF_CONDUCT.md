As contributors and maintainers of the Barathon project, we pledge to respect everyone who contributes by posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, and any other activities.

Communication through the project must be constructive, helpful and make the project progress and evolve in a good way.

We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, or level of experience. We expect anyone contributing to the Barathon project to do the same.

Tech leads, maintainers and integrators may take action if any of these points said above are not respected. It can be a PR that is not correct, code to redo, but also bad behavior and violation of this code of conduct.

If you have any questions regarding this code of conduct or have any other concerns, please contact your actual tech lead.
